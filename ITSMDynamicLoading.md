# ITSM Dynamic Content Loading Implementation (DEPRECATED)

## Overview
**NOTE: This implementation has been deprecated as of September 22, 2025.** The ITSM Module has been migrated to a new route-based implementation using Next.js App Router.

The previous implementation enabled ITSM menu items in the sidebar to load their content dynamically in the main content area without requiring full page navigation.

## New Implementation
The ITSM Module has been moved to a new route structure:
- `/itsm-new` - Main ITSM dashboard
- `/itsm-new/service-catalog` - Service Catalog module
- `/itsm-new/service-requests` - Service Requests module
- `/itsm-new/ticketing` - Incident Management module
- `/itsm-new/billing` - Internal Billing module
- `/itsm-new/change-management` - Change Management module

## Deprecated Components

### 1. ITSM Context (`/context/ITSMContext.tsx`)
- Provided state management for the active ITSM menu item
- Listened for custom events from the sidebar to update the active item
- Exposed `activeITSMItem` and `setActiveITSMItem` for consumption by other components

### 2. ITSM Content Component (`/components/ITSMContent.tsx`)
- Dynamically rendered content based on the active ITSM menu item
- Showed loading state while content was being prepared
- Contained placeholder content for each ITSM module:
  - ITSM Dashboard
  - Service Catalog
  - Service Requests
  - Incident Management (Ticketing)
  - Internal Billing
  - Change Management

### 3. Sidebar Modifications (`/components/layouts/sidebar.tsx`)
- Previously replaced Link components with button elements for ITSM menu items
- Added `handleITSMMenuItemClick` function to:
  - Update the active menu item state
  - Dispatch a custom event (`itsmMenuItemSelected`) with the selected item
  - Handle mobile sidebar closing

### 4. App Wrapper (`/App.tsx`)
- Previously wrapped the main application with `ITSMProvider` to make the context available throughout the app

### 5. Content Animation Component (`/components/layouts/content-animation.tsx`)
- Previously modified to conditionally render `ITSMContent` when an ITSM menu item was active
- Fell back to normal page content when no ITSM item was selected

## How It Previously Worked

1. User clicked on an ITSM menu item in the sidebar
2. The sidebar updated its internal state and dispatched a custom event with the selected item
3. The ITSM context captured this event and updated the active ITSM item
4. The content animation component detected the active ITSM item and rendered the ITSM content component
5. The ITSM content component dynamically loaded and displayed appropriate content based on the selection

## Styling

ITSM-specific styles were defined in `/styles/itsm.css` and imported into the main stylesheet.

## Migration Notes

All ITSM functionality has been migrated to the new route-based implementation. The dynamic loading implementation has been completely removed.
